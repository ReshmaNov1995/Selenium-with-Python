Why WebDriver is an API(Application Programming Interface)?
  Browser(Application Under Test)--->Browser Driver--->Web Driver(API)--->Automation Code.
 Here WebDriver acts as API between AUT & Automation Code.

Database (Backend Layer)---> Application/Web Server(Business Logic/API)---> GUI/UI Layer(Presentation Layer)
Database Testing---> API Testing(PostMan/RestAPI)---> GUI Testing(Selenium)
