Data Driven framework is used to drive test cases and suites from an external data feed. The data feed can be data sheets like xls, xlsx, and csv files.

Install openpyxl
openpyxl - can work with excel files of extensions (.xlsx, .xlsm)

1) Read Data from Excel
2) Write Data into Excel
3) Data Driven TestCase

Structure of Excel File:
      File->workbook->sheets->rows->columns/cells

Whenever data is captured from the Excel file, It is always String data ype. So, If we gonna do validation then it has to be changed to float datatype.


Using Database:
      Install pypyodbc - MS SQL
      Install psycopg2 - Postgres
