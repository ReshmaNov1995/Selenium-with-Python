PyTest Framework can be used to write various types of software tests, including unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, and functional tests. 
Its features include parametrized testing, fixtures, and assert re-writing.

File name should start with test_file name. Ex - test_file01.
Method name should have test. Ex - def test_method

import pytest

Note: Pycharm doesn't support pytest.
So, It has to be run either by terminal or command prompt.

In terminal, pytest -v -s filename
-v verbose will give some details, -s will display the output.
