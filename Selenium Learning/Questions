    Relative Xpath directly jumps to the Element
  
  2)Absolute Xpath starts with /
    Relative Xpath starts with //

4) Which type of Xpath is preferred to use? Why?
    Relative Xpath. 
    It is more stable when compared to Absolute Xpath. 
    Code Modifications & Updations of elements can be handled. Because there is a chance of missing hierarchy in Absolute Xpath.
